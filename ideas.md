## Report a bug
    Have a user friendly way for someone to report a bug within the website.

## Solution
    Well I have three ideas.

    1. Have them send through email to my account (they do not need to sign in, it could just use like a ten-min account to send me the description of the bug)
    2. Make an internal system where the bug description is saved to a database that then can be seen by going to /issues
    3. Make my repo public and have them write an issue in the issue section.

    Not too sure which one I will use.

## Issues
    Show all the bugs that people have reported.

## Problem
    I need to make it so only I can go to /issues and other can't
    But I don't want to make accounts

## Solution
    1. in the url, have /issues/dev=true or something like that. so if dev is false or doesn't exist then say that the user is not allowed to view this.


## Offline
    I want to be able to view the website fully offline 
    So all the images are loaded, all the videos are loaded in (prolly have to use an iframe)

## Problem
    I might have to change the list of movies and shit into a json file that then is converted to a list of objects.
