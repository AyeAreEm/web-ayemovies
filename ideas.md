## Issues
    Show all the bugs that people have reported.

## Problem
    I need to make it so only I can go to /issues and other can't
    But I don't want to make accounts

## Solution
    1. in the url, have /issues/dev=true or something like that. so if dev is false or doesn't exist then say that the user is not allowed to view this.


## Offline
    I want to be able to view the website fully offline 
    So all the images are loaded, all the videos are loaded in (prolly have to use an iframe)

## Problem
    I might have to change the list of movies and shit into a json file that then is converted to a list of objects.
