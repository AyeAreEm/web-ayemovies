# web-ayemovies
123movies but without ads or viruses.

# How it works
- First it gets movies from an external website
- Then it uses a dynamic ejs file and puts the url of the movie into the source

# Movies and Tv Shows that I plan to add
## Animated
    - Avatar
    - Legend of Korra

## Marvel
    - X-Men
    - WandaVision

## Netflix Originals
    - Stranger Things
    - Lucifer
    - You
    - Apostle (maybe)
    - The Umbrella Academy (maybe)
    - Outer Banks

## Fast and Furious

## Harry Potter

## ToDo
    - Report a bug system
    - Analytic System

## Analytics
    - Add an eventListener to check when the website is loaded
    - Once it is loaded, sent a post request to the backend with certain parameters (e.g. the time)
    - On the backend, send the data received and store it in a database
    - Then write a function that checks for the number of entries entered into the database today.
