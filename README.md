# web-ayemovies
123movies but without ads or viruses.

# How it works
- First it gets movies from an external website
- Then it uses a dynamic ejs file and puts the url of the movie into the source

# Movies and Tv Shows that I plan to add
## Animated
    - Despicable Me
    - Avatar
    - Legend of Korra
    - Rio
    - Mr. Peabody and Sherman

## Marvel
    - X-Men
    - Tobey Spider-Man

## Netflix Originals
    - Stranger Things
    - The Queen's Gambit
    - Lucifer
    - You
    - Apostle (maybe)

## Fast and Furious

## ToDo
    - Change the system for getting all movies and putting them into options
        (probably can be done with giving each link an id and using vanilla js to get the href and text content using the id. then iterate through the list of objects)
